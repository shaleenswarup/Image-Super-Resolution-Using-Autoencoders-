# Image-Super-Resolution-Using-Autoencoders
Using this deep learning powered autoencoder to significantly enhance the quality of images. The neural network will create high-resolution images from low-res source images.

# Requirements
* Tensorflow 2.0

* The data used to train the network can be found here https://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html

* The project is implemented on jupyter notebook, which you can get with or anaconda. You can use your own IDE as well.
